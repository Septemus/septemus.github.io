When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end systemsegments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as packets. the two most prominent types in today’s Internet are routers and link-layer switches The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path through the network. ISPs : Internet Service Providers Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must wait in the output buffer . Thus, in addition to the store-and-forward delays, packets suffer output buffer queuing delays . arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for transmission. In this case, packet loss will occur—either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped. a router uses a packet’s destination address to index a forwarding table and determine the appropriate outbound link There are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of links and switches: circuit switching and packet switching . In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems. A circuit in a link is implemented with either frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) or time-division multiplexing (TDM). The most important of these delays are the nodal processing delay , queuing delay , transmission delay , and propagation delay ; The time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct the packet is part of the processing delay. Transmission Delay:amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into the link. The time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to router B is the propagation delay. let a denote the average rate at which packets arrive at the queue (a is in units of packets/sec). Recall that R is the transmission rate; that is, it is the rate (in bits/sec) at which bits are pushed out of the queue. Also suppose, for simplicity, that all packets consist of L bits. Then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue is La bits/sec. The ratio La/R,is called the traffic intensity. If La/R \u003e 1, then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue exceeds the rate at which the bits can be transmitted from the queue. In this unfortunate situation, the queue will tend to increase without bound and the queuing delay will approach infinity. a packet can arrive to find a full queue.With no place to store such a packet, a router will drop that packet; that is, the packet will be lost. a lost packet may be retransmitted on an end-to-end basis in order to ensure that all data are eventually transferred from source to destination. In VoIP, the sending side must first fill a packet with encoded digitized speech before passing the packet to the Internet. This time to fill a packet—called the packetization delay—can be significant and can impact the user-perceived quality of a VoIP call The instantaneous throughput at any instant of time is the rate (in bits/sec) at which clie","date":"2023-10-21","objectID":"/computer_networking_topdownapproach/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Computer Networking Top Down Approach","uri":"/computer_networking_topdownapproach/"},{"categories":["college"],"content":"2.1 HTTP HTTP is said to be a stateless protocol: server sends requested files to clients without storing any state information about the client. Non-Persistent:each request/response pair be sent over a separate TCP connection. Persistent Connections:all of the requests and their corresponding responses be sent over the same TCP connection. HTTP uses persistent connections in its default mode. the steps of transferring a Web page from server to client for the case of non- persistent connections: Let’s suppose the page consists of a base HTML file and 10 JPEG images/computer_networking_topdown, and that all 11 of these objects reside on the same server.Further suppose the URL for the base HTML file is:http://www.someSchool.edu/someDepartment/home.index Here is what happens: The HTTP client process initiates a TCP connection to the server www.someSchool.edu on port number 80, which is the default port number for HTTP. Associated with the TCP connection, there will be a socket at the client and a socket at the server. The HTTP client sends an HTTP request message to the server via its socket. The request message includes the path name /someDepartment/home .index. (We will discuss HTTP messages in some detail below.) The HTTP server process receives the request message via its socket, retrieves the object from path: /someDepartment/home.index from its storage (RAM or disk), encapsulates the object in an HTTP response message, and sends the response message to the client via its socket. The HTTP server process tells TCP to close the TCP connection. (But TCP doesn’t actually terminate the connection until it knows for sure that the client has received the response message intact.) The HTTP client receives the response message. The TCP connection terminates. The message indicates that the encapsulated object is an HTML file. The client extracts the file from the response message, examines the HTML file, and finds references to the 10 JPEG objects. The first four steps are then repeated for each of the referenced JPEG objects. round-trip time (RTT), is the time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to the client. The RTT includes packet-propagation delays, packet-queuing delays in intermediate routers and switches, and packet-processing delays.(the packet is small so there is no transmission delay) Non-persistent connections have some shortcomings. a brand-new connection must be established and maintained for each requested object. For each of these connections, TCP buffers must be allocated and TCP variables must be kept in both the client and server. This can place a significant burden on the Web server, which may be serving requests from hundreds of different clients simultaneously. each object suffers a delivery delay of two RTTs—one RTT to establish the TCP connection and one RTT to request and receive an object. The first line of an HTTP request message is called the request line,the subsequent lines are called the header lines.

How the cookies work: request comes into the Web server, the server creates a unique identification number and creates an entry in its back-end database that is indexed by the identification number. The Web server then responds to client’s browser, including in the HTTP response a Set-cookie: header, which contains the identification number. When Client’s browser receives the HTTP response message, it sees the Set-cookie: header. The browser then appends a line to the special cookie file that it manages. This line includes the hostname of the server and the identification number in the Set-cookie: header. As client continues to browse the site, each time he requests a Web page, his browser consults his cookie file,extracts his identification number for this site, and puts a Cookie header line that includes the identification number in the HTTP request. In this manner, the server is able to track client’s activity at the site.

A user’s browser can be configured so that all of the user’s HTTP requests are first directed to the Web cache. How does web cache work: The browser establishes a TCP connection to the Web cache and sends an HTTP request for the object to the Web cache. The Web cache checks to see if it has a copy of the object stored locally: If it does, the cache performs an up-to-date check by issuing a conditional GET to the web server telling the server to send the object only if the object has been modified since the specified date: If it does then the object is updated. If it doesn’t the object remains the same The Web cache returns the object within an HTTP response message to the client browser. If the Web cache does not have the object, the Web cache opens a TCP connection to the web server, The Web cache then sends an HTTP request for the object into the cache-to-server TCP connection. After receiving this request, the origin server sends the object within an HTTP response to the Web cache. When the Web cache receives the object, it stores a copy in its local storage and sends a copy, within an HTTP response message, to the client browser (over the existing TCP connection between the client browser and the Web cache). The benefits of a web cache: First, a Web cache can substantially reduce the response time for a client request. Second, Web caches can substantially reduce traffic on an institution’s access link to the Internet HTTP has a mechanism that allows a cache to verify that its objects are up to date.

How SMTP works: Alice invokes her user agent for e-mail, provides Bob’s e-mail address (for example,bob@someschool.edu), composes a message, and instructs the user agent to send the message. Alice’s user agent sends the message to her mail server, where it is placed in a message queue. The client side of SMTP, running on Alice’s mail server, sees the message in the message queue. It opens a TCP connection to an SMTP server, running on Bob’s mail server. After some initial SMTP handshaking, the SMTP client sends Alice’s message into the TCP connection. At Bob’s mail server, the server side of SMTP receives the message. Bob’s mail server then places the message in Bob’s mailbox. Bob invokes his user agent to read the message at his convenience. Five commands in SMTP: HELO (an abbreviation for HELLO) MAIL FROM RCPT TO DATA QUIT SMTP uses persistent connection. MTP requires each message, including the body of each message, to be in 7-bit ASCII format. A mail access protocol is used to transfer mail from the recipient’s mail server to the recipient’s user agent. There are currently a number of popular mail access protocols, including Post Office Protocol—Version 3 (POP3), Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP), and HTTP.

How DNS works(approximately): The browser extracts the hostname, from the URL and passes the hostname to the client side of the DNS application. The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server. The DNS client eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP address for the hostname. Once the browser receives the IP address from DNS, it can initiate a TCP connection to the HTTP server process located at port 80 at that IP address The desired IP address is often cached in a “nearby” DNS server, which helps to reduce DNS network traffic as well as the average DNS delay. DNS provides services such as: Host aliasing Mail server aliasing Load distribution there are three classes of DNS servers: root DNS servers top-level domain (TLD) DNS servers authoritative DNS servers How DNS works(in detail): The client first contacts one of the root servers,which returns IP addresses for TLD servers for the top-level domain com. The client then contacts one of these TLD servers, which returns the IP address of an authoritative server for amazon.com. Finally,the client contacts one of the authoritative servers for amazon.com, which returns the IP address for the hostname www.amazon.com. 2 query methods in DNS:recursive queries and iterative queries Typically,The query from the requesting host to the local DNS server is recursive, and the remaining queries are iterative. The DNS servers that together implement the DNS distributed database store resource records (RRs) A resource record is a four-tuple that contains the following fields: Name Value Type TTL TTL is the time to live of the resource record; it determines when a resource should be removed from a cache. If Type=A, then Name is a hostname and Value is the IP address for the hostname. If Type=NS, then Name is a domain (such as foo.com) and Value is the hostname of an authoritative DNS server that knows how to obtain the IP addresses for hosts in the domain. If Type=CNAME, then Value is a canonical hostname for the alias hostname Name. If Type=MX, then Value is the canonical name of a mail server that has an alias hostname Name.

In HTTP streaming, the video is simply stored at an HTTP server as an ordinary file with a specific URL. How HTTP streaming works: When a user wants to see the video, the client establishes a TCP connection with the server and issues an HTTP GET request for that URL. The server then sends the video file, within an HTTP response message. On the client side, the bytes are collected in a client application buffer. Once the number of bytes in this buffer exceeds a predetermined threshold, the client application begins playback—specifically, the streaming video application periodically grabs video frames from the client application buffer, decompresses the frames, and displays them on the user’s screen. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP(DASH):The client dynamically requests chunks of video segments of a few seconds in length. When the amount of available bandwidth is high, the client naturally selects chunks from a high-rate version; and when the available bandwidth is low, it naturally selects from a low-rate version.

How CDN works: The user’s host sends a DNS query for the host name of the requested resource. The user’s Local DNS Server (LDNS) relays the DNS query to an authoritative DNS server for the hostname, which observes in the hostname that this belongs to CDN. To “hand over” the DNS query to CDN, instead of returning an IP address, the authoritative DNS server returns to the LDNS a hostname in the CDN’s domain. The user’s LDNS then sends a second query, now for the hostname provided in 2, and CDN’s DNS system eventually returns the IP addresses of a CDN content server to the LDNS. The LDNS forwards the IP address of the content-serving CDN node to the user’s host. Once the client receives the IP address for a CDN content server, it establishes a direct TCP connection with the server at that IP address and issues an HTTP GET request for the content. Chapter 3 Transport layer Port number is the identifier of the socket. Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is called transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing. This job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket is called demultiplexing. The job of gathering data chunks at the source host from different sockets,encapsulating each data chunk with header information to create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer is called multiplexing. UDP socket is fully identified by a two-tuple consisting of a destination IP address and a destination port number. TCP socket is identified by a four-tuple: (source IP address, source port number,destination IP address,destination port number).

UDP’s advantages over TCP: Finer application-level control over what data is sent, and when. No connection establishment. No connection state. Small packet header overhead. UDP Segment Structure port numbers allow the destination host to pass the application data to the correct process running on the destination end system (that is, to perform the demultiplexing function). The length field specifies the number of bytes in the UDP segment (header plus data). The checksum is used by the receiving host to check whether errors have been introduced into the segment. How checksum works At the sender side,assign the 1s complement(The 1s complement is obtained by converting all the 0s to 1s and converting all the 1s to 0s) of the sum of all the 16-bit words in the segment to the checksum field. At the receiver, all four 16-bit words are added, including the checksum. If no errors are introduced into the packet, then clearly the sum at the receiver will be 1111111111111111. If one of the bits is a 0, then we know that errors have been introduced into the pack. Although UDP provides error checking, it does not do anything to recover from an error.

Pipelining has the following consequences: The range of sequence numbers must be increased. The sender and receiver sides of the protocols may have to buffer more than one packet. The range of sequence numbers needed and the buffering requirements will depend on the manner in which a data transfer protocol responds to lost, corrupted, and overly delayed packets. 3.2.1.1 GBN Go-Back-N (GBN): the sender is allowed to transmit multiple packets (when available) without waiting for an acknowledgment, but is constrained to have no more than some maximum allowable number, N, of unacknowledged packets in the pipeline. Sequence numbers in the interval [0, base-1] correspond to packets that have already been transmitted and acknowledged. The interval [base, nextseqnum-1] corresponds to packets that have been sent but not yet acknowledged. Sequence numbers in the interval [nextseqnum , base+N-1] can be used for packets that can be sent immediately, should data arrive from the upper layer. Finally, sequence numbers greater than or equal to base+N cannot be used until the packet with sequence number base has been acknowledged. the range of permissible sequence numbers for transmitted but not yet acknowledged packets can be viewed as a window of size N over the range of sequence numbers. 3.2.1.2 Selective Repeat As the name suggests, selective-repeat protocols avoid unnecessary retransmissions by having the sender retransmit only those packets that it suspects were received in error (that is, were lost or corrupted) at the receiver. The SR receiver will acknowledge a correctly received packet whether or not it is in order. Out-of-order packets are buffered until all packets with lower sequence numbers are received, at which point a batch of packets can be delivered in order to the upper layer. How Selective Repeat Works Sender Data received from above.When data is received from above, the SR sender checks the next available sequence number for the packet. If the sequence number is within the sender’s window, the data is packetized and sent; other-wise it is either buffered or returned to the upper layer for later transmission,as in GBN. Timeout.Timers are again used to protect against lost packets. However, each packet must now have its own logical timer, since only a single packet will be transmitted on timeout. ACK received.If an ACK is received, the SR sender marks that packet as having been received, provided it is in the window. If the packet’s sequencenumber is equal to send_base, the window base is moved forward to the unacknowledged packet with the smallest sequence number. If the window moves and there are untransmitted packets with sequence numbers that now fall within the window, these packets are transmitted. Receiver Packet with sequence number in [rcv_base, rcvbase+N-1 ] is correctly received.In this case, the received packet falls within the receiver’s window and a selective ACK packet is returned to the sender. If there are previous packets not received, the packet in the middle is buffered. If this packet has a sequence number equal to the base of the receive window , then this packet,and any previously buffered and consecutively numbered packets are delivered to the upper layer. The receive window is then moved forward by the number of packets delivered to the upper layer. Packet with sequence number in [rcv_base-N, rcv_base-1] is correctly received.In this case, an ACK must be generated, even though this is apacket that the receiver has previously acknowledged Otherwise. Ignore the packet. window size must be less than or equal to half the size of the sequence number space for SR protocols.

The TCP “connection” is not an end-to-end TDM or FDM circuit as in a circuit-switched network. Instead,the “connection” is a logical one, with common state residing only in the TCPs in the two communicating end systems. A TCP connection provides a full-duplex service: If there is a TCP connection between Process A on one host and Process B on another host, then application-layer data can flow from Process A to Process B at the same time as application-layer data flows from Process B to Process A. A TCP connection is also always point-to-point, that is, between a single sender and a single receiver. So-called “multicasting”—the transfer of data from one sender to many receivers in a single send operation—is not possible with TCP. The maximum amount of data that can be grabbed and placed in a segment is limited by the maximum segment size (MSS). The MSS is typically set by first determining the length of the largest link-layer frame that can be sent by the local sending host (the so-called maximum transmission unit, MTU), and then setting the MSS to ensure that a TCP segment(when encapsulated in an IP datagram) plus the TCP/IP header length (typically 40 bytes) will fit into a single link-layer frame. Note that the MSS is the maximum amount of application-layer data in the segment, not the maximum size of the TCP segment including headers. a TCP connection consists of buffers, variables, and a socket connection to a process in two hosts of a connection pair. The TCP segment consists of header fields and a data field. When TCP sends a large file, such as an image as part of a Web page, it typically breaks the file into chunks of size MSS (except for the last chunk, which will often be less than the MSS). The Structure Of The TCP Segment the header includes source and destination port numbers. the header includes a checksum field The 32-bit sequence number field and the 32-bit acknowledgment number field are used by the TCP sender and receiver in implementing a reliable data transfer service. The 16-bit receive window field is used for flow control. The 4-bit header length field specifies the length of the TCP header in 32-bit words. The optional and variable-length options field is used when a sender and receiver negotiate the maximum segment size (MSS) or as a window scaling factor for use in high-speed networks. A time-stamping option is also defined. The flag field contains 6 bits: The ACK bit is used to indicate that the value carried in the acknowledgment field is valid. The RST,SYN, and FIN bits are used for connection setup and teardown. The CWR and ECE bits are used in explicit congestion notification. Setting the PSH bit indicates that the receiver should pass the data to the upper layer immediately. the URG bit is used to indicate that there is data in this segment that the sending-side upper-layer entity has marked as “urgent.”The location of the last byte of this urgent data is indicated by the 16-bit urgent data pointer field The sequence number for a segment is the byte-stream number of the first byte in the segment. The acknowledgment number that a host puts in its segment is the sequence number of the next byte the host is expecting from its peer host. TCP only acknowledges bytes up to the first missing byte in the stream, TCP is said to provide cumulative acknowledgments. when a host receives out-of-order segments in a TCP connection,it keeps the out-of-order bytes and waits for the missing bytes to fill in the gaps.

From time to time, the application process in Host B reads from the buffer. Define the following variables: $LastByteRead$: the number of the last byte in the data stream read from the buffer by the application process in B $LastByteRcvd$: the number of the last byte in the data stream that has arrived from the network and has been placed in the receive buffer at B Because TCP is not permitted to overflow the allocated buffer, we must have: $$ LastByteRcvd−LastByteRead≤RcvBuffer $$ The receive window, denoted $rwnd$ is set to the amount of spare room in the buffer: $$ rwnd=RcvBuffer−[LastByteRcvd−LastByteRead] $$ Host B tells Host A how much spare room it has in the connection buffer by placing its current value of $rwnd$ in the receive window field of every segment it sends to A. Host A in turn keeps track of two variables, $LastByteSent$ and $LastByteAcked$,$LastByteSent - LastByteAcked$, is the amount of unacknowledged data that A has sent into the connection Host A makes sure throughout the connection’s life that: $$LastByteSent−LastByteAcked≤rwnd$$ The TCP specification requires Host A to continue to send segments with one data byte when B’s receive window is zero. These segments will be acknowledged by the receiver. Eventually the buffer will begin to empty and the acknowledgments will contain a nonzero $rwnd$ value.

This special segment contains no application-layer data. But one of the flag bits in the segment’s header , the SYN bit, is set to 1. For this reason, this special segment is referred to as a SYN segment. In addition, the client randomly chooses an initial sequence number ($client_isn$) and puts this number in the sequence number field of the initial TCP SYN segment. This segment is encapsulated within an IP datagram and sent to the server. Once the IP datagram containing the TCP SYN segment arrives at the server host (assuming it does arrive!), the server extracts the TCP SYN segment from the datagram, allocates the TCP buffers and variables to the connection, and sends a connection-granted segment to the client TCP.The connection-granted segment is referred to as a SYNACK segment.This connection-granted segment also contains no application-layer data. However, it does contain three important pieces of information in the segment header: the SYN bit is set to 1. the acknowledgment field of the TCP segment header is set to $client_isn+1$ the server chooses its own initial sequence number (server_isn) and puts this value in the sequence number field of the TCP segment header Upon receiving the SYNACK segment, the client also allocates buffers and variables to the connection. The client host then sends the server yet another segment; this last segment acknowledges the server’s connection-granted segment (the client does so by putting the value server_isn+1 in the acknowledgment field of the TCP segment header). The SYN bit is set to zero, since the connection is established. This third stage of the three-way handshake may carry client-to-server data in the segment payload.

This causes the client TCP to send a special TCP segment to the server process. This special segment has a flag bit in the segment’s header, the FIN bit , set to 1. When the server receives this segment, it sends the client an acknowledgment segment in return. The server then sends its own shutdown segment, which has the FIN bit set to 1. Finally, the client acknowledges the server’s shutdown segment. At this point, all the resources in the two hosts are now deallocated. TCP States RST Segment:suppose a host receives a TCP SYN packet with destination port which it is not accepting connections on . Then the host will send a special reset segment to the source.

Approaches to Congestion Control: End-to-end congestion control Network-assisted congestion control The TCP congestion-control mechanism operating at the sender keeps track of an additional variable, the congestion window,denoted $cwnd$. At the beginning of every RTT, the constraint permits the sender to send $cwnd$ bytes of data into the connection; at the end of the RTT the sender receives acknowledgments for the data. Thus the sender’s send rate is roughly $cwnd/RTT \\ bytes/sec$. How TCP Sender Determines Sending Rate A lost segment implies congestion, and hence, the TCP sender’s rate should be decreased when a segment is lost. An acknowledged segment indicates that the network is delivering the sender’s segments to the receiver, and hence, the sender’s rate can be increased when an ACK arrives for a previously unacknowledged segment. TCP congestion-control algorithm consists of 3 components: Slow Start Congestion avoidance fast recovery Slow Start The value of cwnd begins at 1 MSS and increases by 1 MSS every time a transmitted segment is first acknowledged.This process results in a doubling of the sending rate every RTT. If there is a loss event (i.e., congestion) indicated by a timeout, the TCP sender sets the value of cwnd to 1 and begins the slow start process anew. It also sets the value of ssthresh (shorthand for “slow start threshold”) to cwnd/2—half of the value of the congestion window value when congestion was detected. Thus, when the value of cwnd equals ssthresh, slow start ends and TCP transitions into congestion avoidance mode. if three duplicate ACKs are detected, in which case TCP performs a fast retransmit and enters the fast recovery state Congestion Avoidance TCP adopts a more conservative approach and increases the value of cwnd by just a single MSS every RTT. When a timeout occurs. The value of cwnd is set to 1 MSS, and the value of ssthresh is updated to half the value of cwnd when the loss event occurred.TCP transitions to Slow Start mode. Triple duplicate ACK:TCP halves the value of cwnd and records the value of ssthresh to be half the value of cwnd (adding in 3 MSS for good measure to account for the triple duplicate ACKs received). The fast-recovery state is then entered. Fast Recovery The value of cwnd is increased by 1 MSS for every duplicate ACK received for the missing segment that caused TCP to enter the fast-recovery state. when an ACK arrives for the missing segment, TCP enters the congestion-avoidance state after deflating $cwnd$. If a timeout event occurs, fast recovery transitions to the slow-start state after performing the same actions as in slow start and congestion avoidance. How TCP Congestion Control Provides Fairness Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN): Network-assisted Congestion Control:At the network layer, two bits (with four possible values, overall) in the Type of Service field of the IP datagram header are used for ECN: One setting of the ECN bits-ECE (Explicit Congestion Notification Echo) bit is used by a router to indicate that it (the router) is experiencing congestion. This congestion indication is then carried in the marked IP datagram to the destination host, which then informs the sending host. A second setting of the ECN bits is used by the sending host to inform routers that the sender and receiver are ECN-capable Chapter 4 Network Layer Forwarding refers to the router-local action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appro","date":"2023-10-21","objectID":"/computer_networking_topdownapproach/:9:5","tags":null,"title":"Computer Networking Top Down Approach","uri":"/computer_networking_topdownapproach/"},{"categories":["college"],"content":" 1 实验内容 底层用 Verilog HDL 语言实现简单的处理器模块设计。 调用存储器模块设计 64×8 的存储器模块。 顶层用原理图方式将简单的处理器模块和存储器模块连接形成简单的计算机核心 部件组成的系统。 将指令序列存入存储器，然后分析指令执行流程 2 代码/原理图 Warning\r由于本次使用modelsim-altera仿真，仿真时顶层不能用原理图，必须要转换为Verilog文件。\r","date":"2023-06-16","objectID":"/computer_organization_course_design/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"西南交通大学计组实验-课程设计","uri":"/computer_organization_course_design/"},{"categories":["college"],"content":"2.1 顶层文件 ","date":"2023-06-16","objectID":"/computer_organization_course_design/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"西南交通大学计组实验-课程设计","uri":"/computer_organization_course_design/"},{"categories":["college"],"content":"2.1.1 设计用原理图 ","date":"2023-06-16","objectID":"/computer_organization_course_design/:1:1","tags":null,"title":"西南交通大学计组实验-课程设计","uri":"/computer_organization_course_design/"},{"categories":["college"],"content":"2.1.2 仿真用Verilog代码 // Copyright (C) 1991-2013 Altera Corporation // Your use of Altera Corporation's design tools, logic functions // and other software and tools, and its AMPP partner logic // functions, and any output files from any of the foregoing // (including device programming or simulation files), and any // associated documentation or information are expressly subject // to the terms and conditions of the Altera Program License // Subscription Agreement, Altera MegaCore Function License // Agreement, or other applicable license agreement, including, // without limitation, that your use is for the sole purpose of // programming logic devices manufactured by Altera and sold by // Altera or its authorized distributors.

用verilog设计一个8位原码一位乘法运算器。乘数和被乘数均为8位原码，被乘数存放在B寄存器中；C寄存器的初始值存放乘数，运算结束后存放乘积的低位部分；A寄存器用于存放部分积，其初始值是0，运算结束后存放乘积的高位部分。A寄存器和C寄存器可级联在一起右移，CR为乘法步数计数器，在每个时钟信号上升沿处理一位乘法的累加和右移，根据乘数的最低位是否为1决定是加被乘数还是0，乘积的符号位由被乘数和乘数的符号位异或得到

各小方格对应于各变量不同的组合，而且上下左右在几何上相邻的方格内只有一个因子有差别，这个重要特点成为卡诺图化简逻辑函数的主要依据。 2.4.1.3 画法 当逻辑函数为最小项表达式时，在卡诺图中找出和表达式中最小项对应的小方格填上1，其余的小方格填上0（有时也可用空格表示），就可以得到相应的卡诺图。任何逻辑函数都等于其卡诺图中为1的方格所对应的最小项之和。

同一方格可以被不同的包围圈重复包围多次，但新增的包围圈中一定要有原有包围圈未曾包围的方格。 一个包围圈的方格数要尽可能多,包围圈的数目要可能少 当卡诺图中1的个数明显多于0的个数时，可以采取圈0的方式化简，得到原逻辑函数L的反函数，然后再求反，得到L。

高考失利后，我不出意外的和CS相关的专业失之交臂，那时我便做好了转专业的打算。转专业的难度和压力不亚于高考，经历一年的考验我已转入软件工程专业。转专业的过程充满了各种不确定性，信息的匮乏经常使我感到迷茫。因此我趁着目前较为充裕的时间，将关于转专业（特别是计院）的信息进行汇总，并分享自己的心得体会。希望这篇文章对想转入计算机学院的同学有所帮助。

我想，既然打开了此篇文章的同学，大部分做好了充分的思想准备，但是不是每一名同学都具备转计院成功的精力和能力，并且即使具备也不能断言转计院就是全局最优解，或是适合进行计算机方面的学习和工作。同时我也面向思想正在动摇，对于自己是否应该转计院犹豫不决的同学，说不定你看下去会觉得这是个宝贵的机会。 ","date":"2022-09-12","objectID":"/changemajor/:3:0","tags":null,"title":"西南交通大学转专业心得分享","uri":"/changemajor/"},{"categories":["college"],"content":"好处： 行业前景： 以下是19-21年国家统计局发布的各行业就业人员平均工资： 可见IT行业在具有最高平均工资水平的同时，依然维持较高增速。而计院专业主要面向IT行业中最热门的互联网行业。 计院三个专业虽上层建筑不同，但都以CS为基础，因此认真完成本科阶段学习的同学在进入IT行业工作时具备了其他专业同学所望尘莫及的编程能力和牢固基础。三个专业毕业后就业方向主要分为：前端，后端，全栈，算法，嵌入式，每一个方向都有很高的技术要求，面试官更注重应聘者的编程实力而不是文凭或者交际能力，一般来说本科毕业想直接工作就需要提前选择一个方向进行深入练习。 本校就业情况\r根据计算机学院某知名教授透露，软件工程2018级（本科）毕业生签约合同上的平均年薪15万。软件工程15-17级(本科)毕业生平均年薪为17万。其中水平较高者收获了50万以上年薪。\r实现超越： 相信有很多同学和我一样，高考分数可以上这个学校，但不能上这个学校的计算机专业。如果要上计算机专业的话只能退而求其次选择双非学校。 2021年我校所有专业里面计算机是收分最高的，我校在很多省份录取的高考最高分的同学都选择就读计算机专业。 如果转专业成功就同时获得可以读满意的学校和满意的专业。鉴于计算机类年年攀升的录取分数，转专业可以通过一年的劳动实现获得自己想学专业的本科学位，而如果跨考研究生或毕业后再参加培训班则不得不浪费四年的时间学习与自己志向无关的知识（前提是你今后想成为程序员），或只好改变志向。 换句话说，转专业等效于用一年的时间和精力换取高考多几分的待遇。 多样考核： 以计院为例，转专业将参考学生的准入课、四级、机考、面试成绩，可以说是考察了学生全方面的能力，即使学生在某一方面实力并不突出，也可以通过其他方面弥补。 如有同学在机考（实际上因为疫情变成笔试）中发挥糟糕，但还是凭借较高的准入课分和四级分稳住了排名。同时还有和我一起参加考核的同学在面试前的排名中居于末尾，结果凭借出彩的面试表现提高了自己的排名从而被录取。 因此我认为计院的转专业制度具有较好的容错性。多样的考核机制使得失误的影响降低了。 ","date":"2022-09-12","objectID":"/changemajor/:3:1","tags":null,"title":"西南交通大学转专业心得分享","uri":"/changemajor/"},{"categories":["college"],"content":"坏处： 不确定性： 这一点我深有体会，转专业的各方面信息经常残缺且自相矛盾。考前咨询老师的问题很少得到正面答复。在准备的过程中对于自己是否合格也始终无法得到准确的答案。更可怕的是因为极端原因突然修改了考核方式，这一点我深有体会：因为疫情机考和面试改为线上进行，但是机考竟然变成了手写代码的形式，一方面失去了编译器的检查功能，另一方面大大增强了改卷的主观性。而且老师拒绝回复关于题型的问题（有没有选择填空都不说），我直到拿到卷子才知道没有选择填空。 这些不确定性会让你做不少的无效劳动，有时甚至让你感到愤怒。 沉没成本： 学习不是大学生活的全部，阅读、运动、社交、兴趣爱好同样是大学生活的一部分，而转专业会占据你大量的空余时间，结果便是你需要延续高三的学习强度，无法在时间最充裕的一年级体会丰富的大学生活。而如果转专业以失败告终，那你大一失去的时间、付出的精力将付诸东流。 心理压力： 转专业的欲望越强烈，越容易受到外界扰动的刺激，心理压力也越大。你白天学习的时候会忍不住浏览论坛搜寻其他同学对于转专业的讨论，然后被一些危言耸听搞得六神无主，结果因为焦虑无法集中注意力。晚上会翻来覆去思索转专业失败的对策，无法入睡。和亲友交谈时，你得到了鼓励却感觉是难以实现的期望，你得到了安慰却感觉是失败主义的灌输。这都是你需要承受的心理包袱，它们可能会损害你的身体健康和人际关系。 适应变化： 即使转专业成功也要面临专业现实情况和自己想象的落差。一方面，需要补大一没上的必修课，导致平时作业多时间紧（但计院早八确实很少）。另一方面，迁移到新的集体中需要适应这个集体的管理特点（各学院和班级有截然不同的氛围）。另一方面，需要处理转专业成功后繁琐的事务，比如课程替代，团组织身份转移，重新选课。 Dormitary\r关于寝室：若住在犀浦，学校不会安排更换寝室，若要更换寝室需要走常规流程（一般很不容易）。若住在九里，学校会安排更换寝室，学生自主表决。若同意，去哪个寝室取决于人数情况，和同专业同学是舍友概率较小。 更换寝室手续非常繁琐而且牵扯搬运生活用品。并且最终如果舍友和自己专业不一样的话会出现作息时间冲突的问题。\rTL:DR\r对于有志进入IT业（特别是互联网、软件业）的同学来说，转专业是花费时间最短，以能力为唯一标准的机会。然而想把握住这个机会需要持之以恒的努力、大一处于持续紧张的精神状态。同时，机遇与风险共存，走上转专业的道路就要做好迎接失败的心理准备。\r","date":"2022-09-12","objectID":"/changemajor/:3:2","tags":null,"title":"西南交通大学转专业心得分享","uri":"/changemajor/"},{"categories":["college"],"content":"指标

事实上，原排的重要性在各大论坛（尤其是贴吧）被夸大了，几乎每一个询问转计院的帖子都会强调原排的重要性，甚至有人夸张地声称只有每个学院第一第二名才有机会。 然而原专业排名既不是门槛，也不是直接指标，只是面试时的参考因素。2022年没有出现因为低原排而不让同学参加机考的情况。筛选同学进入面试时，只根据准入课、四级、机考三项指标，无视原排。我在面试时老师也没有询问我的原排。鉴于面试占总分的25%，而原排只是面试时的参考因素之一，可以得出结论原排不是转计院的决定因素，更不可能出现其他方面优秀，因为原排低而被淘汰的现象。 证据方面，我通过比对往年录取名单，发现既有同学原排极高被淘汰，又有同学原排甚至未达前40%而被录取。 专业区别论 我一开始以为三个专业分别有自己的名额，并且报不同的专业就不在一起排名。在这个假设之下，我根据报CS的人数远多于报软工的人数，而去年AI招收人数远少于SE招收人数，我得出了报SE会增加录取机会的错误结论。 事实上我的假设一开始就是错的，并且我发现论坛上也有这种假设。参加转计院的所有学生会一起排名，报考的专业不会对成功率有任何影响。最终录取也是学院按照总分排名从高到低选拔。假如计院录取名额为N，那么有且仅有总分排名前N的同学被录取，即使他们全部都报CS也不会有任何影响。

若有多余时间最好参加竞赛或学习做项目。如参加程序设计竞赛、数学建模，写个贪吃蛇的小游戏之类的。这些不一定要做到极致，比如我大一参加的三个竞赛名气都不大，拿的奖项也不突出。但可避免自己在面试时处于被动（面试有很大概率询问计算机相关课外经历）
